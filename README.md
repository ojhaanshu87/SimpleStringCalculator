# SimpleStringCalculator
The String Calculator TDD Kata is a small project where we build a simple calculator that can process a string of comma-separated numbers (and numbers separated by newlines). The objective of this project is to follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, starting from simple test cases and gradually adding more functionality.
